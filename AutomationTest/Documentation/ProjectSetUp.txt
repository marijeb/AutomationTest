## Set up ##
	# Nuget packages via Manage Nuget Packages for Solution:
		* Selenium.WebDriver
		* Selenium.Support
		* Selenium.Chrome.WebDriver // ensure version is compatible with the Chrome version that is used
		* Selenium.WebDriver.IEDriver
		* MSTest.TestAdapter
		* MSTest.TestFramework
	# Add Refence:
		* System.Configuration

## Framework Structure ##
* BaseClass: contains classes for starting and stopping the Webdriver
* Component Helper: contains classes specific to web component
* Configuration: contains classes for reading data from app.config file
* ExcelReader: contains classes for reading data from Excel file
* Interfaces: contains interface for reading data from file
* PageObject: contains classes specific Page Object Model
* Settings: contains classes for constant key
* CustomExeception contains classes user define exception
* TestScript: conatins automtion script

## Configuration File ##
* App.congig file is suded for storing configuration 
* To load the configuration "System.Configuration" is used. This is a built utlity of Visual Studio
* To use it reference "System.Configuration" needs to added to References in the project
* The class that is in reading the configuraion from "App.config" is "ConfigurationManager"
* Inside "ConfigurationManager" there is a property "AppSettings"
* "AppSettings" has a "Get" method which takes "Key" as an srgument and return its "Value"
* All configuration inside "Aop.config" is of type "string"

## IConfig Interface ##
* This interface will contain basic method which is required for our framework such "GetBrowser"
* All the classes which are going to read data from external file system have to implement this interface
* The reason of enforcing this restriction is there are basic methods which are important for the framework to initialize
